<a name="tpb"></a><h2>Extending the Theory of Planned Behavior to multi-choice situations</h2>

<p>Because my undergraduate career was focused on science communication and environmental issues, I developed an interest in 
studies of pro-environmental behaviors and decision making. I began a study on the role of self-identity in the Theory of 
Planned Behavior with an anti-environmental behavior--consumption of bottled water--as the target behavior. I worked with Dr. 
Alex Rothman and Dr. Alex Maki (at the time, a PhD Candidate, now a post doctoral researcher at Vanderbilt University) on the 
study. We looked to see what role self-identity played in the Theory of Planned Behavior and if it helped to explain variance 
above and beyond the variables already included in the Theory of Planned Behavior. After completing my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxZJchcXuPabNE9sczA4c240cUU/view?usp=sharing">
	undergraduate thesis,</a> 
we started work on a follow-up study looking at multi-choice decision making using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a model 
(study is ongoing).
