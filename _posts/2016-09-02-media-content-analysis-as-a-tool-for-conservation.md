title: "Media content analysis as a tool for conservation"</br>

<p>
Given my background in public relations and communications before I decided to study ecology, I'm interested in the role communication plays in ecology and conservation biology. Recently, I began thinking about how conservation-oriented ecological research is portrayed in the media and if anyone is studying this topic. 
</p><p>
The best tool for studying media coverage of an issue is a media content analysis, so I did a quick search through the literature for studies that included both "media content analysis" and "conservation" and did not come up with much. The articles that I did find were primarily focused on large carnivores (Alexander and Quinn, 2011; Bhatia et al., 2013; Jacobson et al., 2012; Siemer et al., 2007). The Jacobson et al. article on media coverage of the Florida panther is an excellent example of using media content analysis to explore public opinions on ecological research and conservation issues, so I will focus on that article. I'm omitting citations because they're all in the Jacobson et al. article, which I would encourage you to read.</p>

<h2>Background: Agenda-setting Theory and Framing</h2>

<p>The media does not simply reflect current public opinions on an issue; it helps to shape and define those opinions. According to agenda-setting theory, the media influences not just <i>what</i> we talk about, but <i>how</i> we talk about it. There are three primary ways that this is done: 1) the quantity of coverage, 2) the tone (positive or negative) of an article, and 3) the frame through which a topic is presented. All of these factors can be studied through media content analysis.
</p><p>
The quantity of coverage tells us how important an issue is and how much attention we should be paying to it. If an issue is only discussed in one or two short articles, it will quickly fade from the public consciousness. However, if an issue is covered in several long articles in multiple sources over a long span of time, it is likely to remain in the public consciousness and be treated as an important topic. You could probably call this the "Kardashian effect" because no single article about them merits the amount of attention they receive, but because of the frequency of publications about them, they are treated as an "important" issue that receives additional attention.
</p><p>
The tone of an article (also sometimes called the valence) impacts how the public feels about an issue. This is intricately linked to how an issue is framed. Frames are the ways in which an issue is presented and often manifest themselves in the overarching story being told in an article. We like stories to be coherent and cohesive, so journalists typically present us with a neatly packaged article that we can easily follow because it's only about one aspect of an issue. The sources cited by a journalist often play the largest role in determining whether an article is positive or negative. 
</p><p>
To demonstrate the relationship between frames and tone, let's look at the example of large carnivores, which could be Florida panthers, or wolves near Yellowstone, or mountain lions in the southwest.</p>

<h2>The Jacobson et al. Study</h2>

<p>Large carnivores are well-suited to studies of media coverage because they elicit strong feelings from members of the public. They are often perceived as threatening human lives, harming livestock, or limiting recreation, but we are also awed by their beauty, secretive ways, and wildness. These perceptions generate large amounts of media coverage due to the role humans play in conflicts and our fascination with charismatic megafauna. 
</p><p>
For their study, Jacobson et al. looked at articles, editorials, and letters to the editor that were published in six newspapers around the state of Florida. A total of 513 articles published in these sources that were related to Florida panthers were retrieved from an online database. The content of the articles was used to classify them as being primarily or secondarily about panthers, as fitting into one of eleven themes, whether the tone was positive or negative, and a number of other factors. 
</p><p>
What Jacobson et al. found in their study was that the frames used for articles differed between local papers and statewide papers. Local papers tended to focus more on risks to humans and livestock, whereas statewide articles centered on general biology of the Florida panther. Local papers tended to publish articles that reported positively on risks, reassuring the public of low probabilities of panther attacks. Both local and statewide papers published positive articles about urban development, urging the public to support responsible development that manages land to benefit panther populations. In general, the articles included in the study tended to portray conservation of the Florida panther as either neutral or positive.

<h2>Implications for Ecologists and Conservation Biologists</h2>

<p>Because media coverage shapes public opinion, it can either aid in conservation efforts through positive coverage that generates support, or it can create resistance to conservation efforts through negative coverage. As ecologists, we should be advocates (more on this at a later date) for using research to benefit the populations that we study. Knowing how to leverage the media is a valuable skill for researchers, but first it requires understanding what the media is already saying about our topic. This can be accomplished through media content analysis.
</p><p>
Knowing what frames are used and the tone of articles can help us better understand public opinion on important conservation issues. As Jacobson et al. put it, "understanding the nature of media coverage in carnivore conservation may help scientists and managers perform more effective outreach or management activities." In other words, we need to know what the public already thinks in order to influence them to support conservation efforts. Media coverage serves as a proxy for measuring public opinion because the content has helped to shape what those opinions are. 
</p><p>
Another reason for conservation biologists and ecologists to study media content is to be able to craft better messages to the media. If we know what frames are being used in the media to discuss our research, we will be better equipped to talk to journalists and pitch stories about conservation research and management. Selecting an existing frame that the media uses to talk about the issue, then presenting a cohesive story with a positive tone can generate the type of media coverage that researchers would like to see on an issue. 
</p><p>
I would encourage all ecologists and conservation biologists to delve into the media coverage of their area of interest, and to consider conducting a media content analysis to learn more about how the public perceives their topic and what some avenues for better public outreach might be. </p>
