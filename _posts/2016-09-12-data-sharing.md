title: "Data sharing"

<p>Publications are the currency of academia. Although there are numerous problems associated with this accepted fact (e.g. low motivation to do meta-analyses or synthesis papers, low quality publications produced in favor of quantity, etc...) I want to focus on the aspect I find the most troubling: disincentivization of data sharing. Sure, publications are increasingly authored by multiple authors from different institutions, which is a marked shift from single-author papers of the "old days" in research, but that's not the kind of sharing I'm talking about. The multiple authors on a paper can really be considered as one cohesive unit - they have all contributed to the planning, data collection, analysis, etc... of the paper and they are all going to receive the same reward for their work: a publication. Not to researchers are all publication junkies willing to do anything for a reward, but we're certainly less likely to be critical of a project on which we worked. This is where data sharing comes in.

Data sharing is an incredibly simple idea that is central to the open science movement: data should be shared. This is even a requirement for most government-funded studies these days, but researchers still try to find ways around it by sharing only some of the data from their study. Why do we do this? Because we want to crank as many publications out of one data set as possible. If we share our data, we're afraid that other researchers will take advantage of our hard work and "scoop" us on a publication by analyzing the data we collected and publishing the findings first. Even worse, we're afraid that someone could misinterpret our data because they don't know the study system well enough or are missing other valuable information. So, we collect our data, we analyze the parts relevant to our project, and then we lock the data up somewhere safe and secure where it will never get touched again. It's like being a pack rat, but instead of keeping dusty broken clocks and tattered dolls in boxes in the attic, we store incredibly valuable information in old filing cabinets at the back of the research lab or a departmental storage room.

Although there are a good many reasons to share data (e.g. public access to science, reducing duplicate efforts for other researchers, etc...) I want to focus on the selfish benefits to the researcher. The benefits of data sharing for you, as a researcher and data collector, fall into three categories that all conveniently begin with the letter 'C': 1) criticism, 2) creativity, 3) citations.

<b>Criticism.</b> As I alluded to earlier, co-authors tend to be a relatively cohesive unit and although we like to think we're good self-critics, we generally aren't as critical of our own studies as we should be. By sharing our data, other researchers in the field can criticize our methods, analysis, and conclusions we draw from the data. You could think of it as being an extended peer review where you get feedback from a lot more researchers than just the ones who reviewed your paper. This criticism helps us improve future studies and get additional perspectives on our work.

<b>Creativity.</b> You know how I said that we're afraid someone is going to "misinterpret" our data? Let's revisit that fear, because I'm going to argue that it might not be a bad thing. When we approach a data set that isn't our own and we don't have any preconceived notions about what questions it is supposed to answer, we can come up with some incredibly creative ways of looking at the data. These creative interpretations can lead to new research questions, and as the expert on the data set, you can study them! Sometimes, your fears will almost certainly come true and someone will analyze your data in a way that isn't true to the system in which you collected it. The good news is that we have a peer review process for a reason and mistakes like this will be caught and corrected.

<b>Citations.</b> This comes back to how much researchers love to publish data and get credit for their work because publications are academic currency. Just because you've shared your data doesn't mean you lose ownership of it. Any studies relying on your dataset are required to cite you, which means more exposure for your study and all the benefits that come with that (namely, a large ego boost and possibly some more grant funding down the line).

I strongly encourage all researchers, particularly those early in their careers who haven't amassed large collections of data yet, to look into data sharing and other principles of the open science movement. The <a href="http://pantonprinciples.org/">Panton Principles</a> and the <a href="http://science.okfn.org/">Open Science Working Group</a> are good places to start exploring. </p>
