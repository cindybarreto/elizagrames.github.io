<p>This blog isn't for you. It's for me. What you learn from it is entirely secondary to its true purpose. This blog is a chance for me to practice writing in a non-technical manner, to explore and come to understand new concepts (to me, at least) by blogging about them, and to give me a chance to reflect on topics in ecology besides just my dissertation research. I hope that some of the posts are interesting, educational, or at least not unpleasant for you to read and that you find some value in the topics I write about. 
</p>
<p>For this blog, I plan to write primarily about current research trends in ecology and conservation biology with a focus on bird populations. I will also be exploring some research methods and writing up basic summaries, tracing the development of concepts back through their history, and writing on any variety of other topics that pique my interest. Some blogs may focus directly on topics that support my dissertation research, especially when I'm learning about research methods. For example, I already know that I want to learn a good deal more about heterophil-lymphocyte and haematocrit levels as a measure of fitness, which will almost certainly be the focus of a blog post or two. Of course, when field season starts, I'll have lots of reflections on data collection and everything that goes wrong when ecologists are in the field. 
</p>
<p>What I really want you to know is that you shouldn't expect anything from this blog, because it isn't for you. It's for me and will help to develop my skills as I navigate five years of my PhD program in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. When I'm set to defend my dissertation, I hope I can look back and have a record of all the things I learned and explored that led me to that point and all the setbacks along the way. </p>
