		<h3>Current position</h3>

		<p>
			I'm a PhD Candidate in Dr. Chris Elphick's lab in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut. I'm broadly interested in using evidence synthesis to improve models in ecology with a focus on conservation. If you want to get in touch or have questions about my research, please feel free to email me at eliza.grames@uconn.edu or get in touch with me through the links below. </p>

  <h2>Research</h2>
<hr>
  <h3>Improving ecological theory and conceptual models with evidence synthesis</h3>
  I use a combination of systematic reviews and graph theory to build conceptual models of ecological processes and patterns in order to bring together pieces of evidence from different studies into a complete model of a system. I am also working on ways to improve the process of generating search terms for systematic reviews using keyword co-occurrence networks (KCNs) to identify important keywords, similar to MeSH headings in medical systematic reviews. With KCNs, I am also looking at how fields have developed and changed over time in order to predict future important research topics.

  <h3>Species interactions, area sensitivity, and animal behavior in fragmented forests</h3>
  I study why some birds respond negatively to decreasing patch sizes in fragmented forests and the underlying mechanisms of area sensitivity. Because ovenbirds are known to be area sensitive, I study their breeding behaviors, nest site selection, and factors leading to nest failure such as predation, brood parasitism, and low food availability. I am using methods like meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) and Bayesian path analysis to get at the causal relationships between hypothesized drivers of area sensitivity and bird responses to patch size. These factors can then be used to improve species distribution models for area sensitive birds by incorporating important ecological processes and interactions.

  <h2>Teaching and Workshops</h2>
<hr>
  <h3>Evolution</h3> As the TA, I attend all lectures to assist Dr. Simon with classroom management and activities. I worked with Dr. Simon to make the class more interactive; we added iClicker questions, peer groups, and four assignments to get students more involved in the class and to reduce the focus on exams. (Fall 2018)

  <h3>Ornithology</h3> I attended all lectures to assist Dr. Rubega with classroom management and activities. I graded all student work, including quizzes, papers, and exams. I also held weekly office hours for students to ask questions about lecture concepts or papers. (Spring 2017; Spring 2018)

<h3>Structural Equation Modeling "SEMinar"</h3>
After taking Bill Shipley's <a href="http://www.billshipley.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/ecole%20ete%20analyse%20des%20pistes.htm">seminar on path analysis at the University of Sherbrooke </a>, I coordinated a meeting group of graduate students and faculty in my department interested in learning about on structural equation modeling. I split the meeting into an hour and a half of lecture on concepts and theory and then an hour and a half of application and coding models in R. (Fall 2017)

  <h3>General Ecology</h3> I led two discussion sections per week to teach skills in ecology and to reinforce lecture topics. (Fall 2017)

  <h3>Intro to basic stats in R</h3>
  I organized a weekly, semester-long meeting group for graduate students and upper division undergraduate students from three departments to learn how to do basic data manipulation, visualization, and statistics in R. The goal of the meetings was to familiarize students with the R programming language to provide a baseline level of familiarity so that students can learn more advanced techniques on their own that apply to their own research. (Spring 2017)

  <h3>Foundations of Biology</h3> With my co-TA, I taught two lab sections of biology for non-majors. I alternated being the lead-TA and assistant-TA with my co-TA; we presented brief lectures to students on the topic of the lab, walked them through the procedure, and assisted students with the lab. (Fall 2016)
