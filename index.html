	<p>I'm a current graduate student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut. I'm pursuing a PhD under the advisement of Dr. Chris Elphick (link). My focus is on avian ecology, especially forest fragmentation due to urbanization and its impacts on bird populations. 

This is a bit of a change from what I studied during my undergraduate career at the University of Minnesota where I graduated with a B.S. and a B.A., both <i>summa cum laude</i>. I wanted to work in science communication to help interpret scientific research for members of the public in order to inform decisions related to conservation of biodiversity, climate change, and other environmental issues. To achieve that goal, I triple-majored in Professional Strategic Communication (Public Relations), Communication Studies, and Environmental Sciences, Policy, and Management with a minor in Biology. 

After finishing my undergrad, I worked for the Minnesota Academy of Science, Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory, and National Academic Quiz Tournaments (NAQT), as well as volunteering for various conservation and bird related projects. You can read more about my prior work experience and research on other sections of my web page.
