	<p><b>BIOL 1102: Foundations of Biology</b><br>
I am co-teaching two lab sessions for BIOL 1102 in Fall 2016, which is intended as an introductory biology course for 
students not majoring in biology or related fields. The lecture portion of the class is taught by Dr. Adam Fry, 
who also supervises the lab sessions.
