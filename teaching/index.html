	<b>Structural Equation Modeling "SEMinar":</b> After taking Bill Shipley's <a href="http://www.billshipley.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/ecole%20ete%20analyse%20des%20pistes.htm">seminar on path analysis at the University of Sherbrooke </a>, I coordinated a meeting group of graduate students and faculty in my department interested in learning about on structural equation modeling. I split the meeting into an hour and a half of lecture on concepts and theory and then an hour and a half of application and coding models in R. 
  <br><br>
  <b>Intro to basic stats in R:</b> I organized a weekly, semester-long meeting group for graduate students and upper division undergraduate students from three departments to learn how to do basic data manipulation, visualization, and statistics in R. The goal of the meetings was to familiarize students with the R programming language to provide a baseline level of familiarity so that students can learn more advanced techniques on their own that apply to their own research.
  <br><br>
  <b>General Ecology (Fall 2017):</b> As a teaching assistant (TA) for General Ecology, I lead two discussion sections per week to teach skills in ecology and to reinforce lecture topics.
  <br><br>
  <b>Ornithology (Spring 2017):</b> As the TA for Ornithology, I attended all lectures to assist Dr. Rubega with classroom management and activities. I graded all student work, including quizzes, papers, and exams. I also held weekly office hours for students to ask questions about lecture concepts or papers. 
  <br><br>
  <b>Foundations of Biology (Fall 2016):</b> With my co-TA, I taught two lab sections of biology for non-majors. I alternated being the lead-TA and assistant-TA with my co-TA; we presented brief lectures to students on the topic of the lab, walked them through the procedure, and assisted students with the lab.
