  Patrick Carr (summer 17) is a recent UConn grad who helped with point count surveys, nest searches, pitfall trap placement and collection, and data entry. Here he is shown pointing to an ovenbird nest; images of nests like this were used to relocate the nests in future visits.
  <br><br>Ben Ranelli (summer '17) is an undergraduate at UConn majoring in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. He helped with point count surveys, nest searches, and pitfall trap collection. Ben also created an independent project on nest provisioning and worked with a volunteer from the Master Naturalist class at Goodwin Conservation Center to assist in his data collection. Here Ben is shown helping out on the first day of the field season.
  <br><br>David Mathieu (summer '17) is an undergraduate at UConn majoring in Chemistry who helped with point count surveys, nest searches, and pitfall trap collection. Here he is shown checking on nestling status for an ovenbird nest that he located by observing adults and following them to the nest. 
  <h3>Lab techs</h3>
  Lisa Russo (Spring 2017) was an undergraduate at UConn who helped update a database of studies on area sensitivity for potential meta-analysis.
  <br><br>Amanda Hewes (Fall 2017) is an undergraduate at UConn taking a lead on role on a project to identify and weigh invertebrates caught in pitfall traps in Connecticut forest fragments. Amanda came up with the organizational scheme for data entry and wrote a protocol for other students to follow for the project.
  <br><br>Laura Jones (Fall 2017) is an undergraduate at UConn helping to identify and weigh invertebrates. 
  <br><br>Jensen Mezzio (Fall 2017) is a sophomore at UConn double-majoring in Chemistry and EEB helping to identify and weigh invertebrates.
