	<p>I'm pursuing a PhD in Dr. Chris Elphick's lab in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut. I'm broadly interested in ecological modeling and applying mathematical models to population processes and conservation biology. My dissertation research is on mechanisms underlying area sensitivity using forest songbirds in southern New England forest fragments as a model. If you want to get in touch or have questions about my research, please feel free to email me at eliza.grames@uconn.edu or get in touch with me through the links below.
